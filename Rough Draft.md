United States Gun Control

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Gun control has been a hot debate in the United States of late. Politicians have pushed for many regulations including:
•	background checks
•	mental health evaluations
•	assault rifle bans
•	implementation of a mandatory buyback program.  
The problem with most of these proposed solutions is the encroachment on American freedom. Gun violence might be an issue that America will have to put up with in order to keep the core principles of what makes the United State what it is.

SUBSECTION SUB-HEADER (HEADER 2)

Buy back programs: A buy back program is not feasible for the United States. Australia implemented a buy back program for assault-style firearms in 1996; It produced results. They paid $100 per gun. Australia’s homicide rate via assault rifles dropped, albeit not dramatically. Australia boasted taking 700,000 firearms out of the public hand. 
The Problem: Statistics show that there is a firearm for every citizen of the United States. The current U.S. population is over 300 million. If the government could get every gun at $100 a piece, this would make upwards of 16% of the nations debt. 
Then there’s the 5th amendment which states, “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation”. Firearms, specifically assault rifles, cost substantially more than $100. 
Due to the 5th amendment, a firearm buyback would prove far too expensive for the government to implement. 
On top of the 5th amendment is the 2nd amendment which states, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” So, even if the government could afford to buy back all of the nation’s firearms, it would be illegal to deprive U.S. citizens of their arms. 
Why doesn’t the government just buy back the assault rifles and leave citizens with shotguns and pistols? Well, one could make the case that the United States military’s firepower already far surpasses its citizen’s. Full auto firearms-which are already illegal without a permit- are not accessible to the average citizen. The purpose of the 2nd amendment is to allow the nation’s citizens protection from their government. We currently wouldn’t stand a fighting chance against the government if it decided to turn on its citizens. Semi-automatic firearms don’t match up to tanks, drones, or high-tech rocket launchers. This was a problem our forefathers couldn’t have foreseen.
